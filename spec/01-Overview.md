# Overview

KTex is a markup language designed to streamline the preparation of
publications. On its own, KTex's functionality is minimal, but its modular
design allows for extensive customization and a broad range of capabilities.

## Design Principles

1. **Tiny Core**. The KTex specification is small. As a markup language, KTex
   focuses on its core purpose and does not attempt to serve as a
   general-purpose programming language.

2. **Extensible** (via modules). The compact core of KTex can be transformed
   into a powerful tool with the help of modules. These modules, written in a
   supported programming language, can be distributed and shared just like any
   other software.

3. **CI/CD friendly**. KTex is designed for integration into CI/CD pipelines,
   thereby supporting a broad spectrum of use cases, from straightforward blog
   posts to intricate publication processes.
